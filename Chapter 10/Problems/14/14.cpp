  A is the root. The left subtree is rooted at B and the right is rooted at D.
  Consider the B subtree: B is the root, there is no left subtree. The right
  subtree is rooted at C. C is a leaf. Consider the D subtree. D is the root,
  E is the root of the left subtree and F is the root of the right subtree.
  E and F are leaves.
